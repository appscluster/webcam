This is a quick little script that grabs an image from the webcam
once every second, and then applies some transformations to it.
The webcam control is VideoCapture, which only works on Windows
systems. I use PIL for the image manipulation. For more info on
those packages:
VideoCapture--http://videocapture.sourceforge.net/

This code example from technobabbler showed me the way:

If you're looking to do something similar on linux, this might
be a good resource:
